# Citizen Management System

### Introduction
The Citizen Management System is a comprehensive web application developed to manage and process personal information of Vietnamese citizens. With the goal of providing a secure, convenient, and transparent platform, this product allows citizens to access personal information and interact with government agencies easily. The system is named "Citizen Management System" and is built with two main components: the front-end using the Nuxt.js framework and the back-end using the Spring framework

### Project Context

The process of developing this product started with the idea of me and my friend. Currently, communicating and processing information with government agencies is sometimes difficult and cumbersome. Therefore, I chose this topic to offer a convenient solution, improve convenience and create transparency in the management of personal information.

### Project Timeline

The development of the product started in Feb 2023 and was completed after 4 months of work. This process includes the stages of research, design, development, and testing.

### Role in the Development Process

During product development, I took on the role of a Front-End Developer. The product is the result of a team of 2 people, in which we take care of UI/UX design and front-end development, testing. In addition, I also participate in discussing issues that arise during the implementation process with you. In this role, I learned a lot about the web, developed creative thinking and asked about the process to perfect a product.
